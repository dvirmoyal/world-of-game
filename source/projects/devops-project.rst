CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes
=================================

This page provides a detailed explanation of the CI/CD pipeline implementation using Kubernetes, GitOps methodology, and other modern DevOps tools.

Overview
--------

The CI/CD pipeline was designed to enable seamless deployments and version management in a Kubernetes environment.

**Key Features:**

1. **Semantic Versioning:**
   - Automatically assigns a version to Docker images based on `Conventional Commits` rules.
   - Integrates with GitHub Actions for building, testing, and releasing artifacts.

2. **GitOps Deployments:**
   - Uses **ArgoCD** for declarative GitOps-based deployments.
   - Automatically updates Kubernetes deployments with the latest Docker image tags using **ArgoCD Image Updater**.

3. **HELM Chart Management:**
   - Streamlines the deployment of Kubernetes applications.
   - Separates configuration from application code for modularity and flexibility.

4. **Secrets Management with Vault:**
   - Stores and injects application secrets securely using HashiCorp Vault.
   - Automates secrets retrieval using Kubernetes authentication.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implements centralized monitoring with **Grafana** and **Prometheus**.
   - Leverages **AWS CloudWatch** for real-time logs and metrics.

6. **Infrastructure as Code:**
   - Deploys AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS) using **Terraform**.
   - Ensures consistency and repeatability in infrastructure provisioning.

Workflow Steps
--------------

1. **Code Commit:**
   - Developers push code changes to a Git repository following the `Conventional Commits` standard.

2. **GitHub Actions Build Pipeline:**
   - Triggers automated builds and tests.
   - Generates a Docker image tagged with a semantic version.

3. **Pushing Docker Images:**
   - Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., **GitHub Container Registry**).

4. **ArgoCD Sync:**
   - ArgoCD syncs the updated Helm charts and applies changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

5. **Application Deployment:**
   - Kubernetes applies the updated configuration and restarts pods as needed.
